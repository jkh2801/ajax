<h2>A Simple Component</h2>
<p>
React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.

JSX is optional and not required to use React. Try the Babel REPL to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation step.

In addition to taking input data (accessed via this.props), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via this.state). When a componentâ€™s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking render().

Using props and state, we can put together a small Todo application. This example uses state to track the current list of items as well as the text that the user has entered. Although event handlers appear to be rendered inline, they will be collected and implemented using event delegation.

Actor Park Han-byul has moved to Jeju Island with her husband and son, according to local media.
 
Park has sold her house in Seoul and is currently living on Jeju with her family, Star New reports. The actor has been off the grid since "Love in Sadness," her last drama series in MBC, ended in April 2019.
 
Her husband Yu In-seok is on trial for his involvement in the Burning Sun scandal. He is suspected of embezzlement, commercial sex trafficking-related offenses and the violation of the Food Sanitation Act and the Act on Specific Economic Crimes.
 
After it was reported that Yu was a business partner of Seungri, Park uploaded an apology on her Instagram in March.
 
"I'm so sorry to have caused trouble to many of those around me due to disputes, events and suspicions related to my husband," Park wrote. "I am truly thankful to those who support me and offer a heartfelt apology to those who criticize me for all the disputes related to my family."
 
According to reports, Park has settled down and is living peacefully in Jeju. As she seems to have moved out of Seoul completely, it is unlikely she will be returning to her career anytime soon.
 
Park debuted as a model in the pages of Ceci in 2002 and made her screen debut in 2003 in "Wishing Stairs," a horror film.
 
She met Yu while she was appearing in MBC drama series "Borg Mom" in 2017 and broke the news of her pregnancy and marriage in November that year. She gave birth to her son in April 2018.
